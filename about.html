            <h1>About Halloween</h1>
            <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2020 will occur on Saturday, October 31. 
                The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear 
                costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all 
                saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All 
                Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving 
                jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.
                
                Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). 
                The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, 
                the United Kingdom and northern France, celebrated their new year on November 1.
                
                This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year 
                that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, 
                the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 
                they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Christy and I am a Graphic Design major at Kelloggo Community College. I graduated from Athens
                High School and attended the Calhoun Area Career Center. Since KCC has converted to virtual learning, I’m
                usually home or I go to work at Macy’s. I have 3 cats named Katharine Hepburn, Edgar Allen Poe, and Moe Moe.
                Halloween hasalways been my favorite holiday ever since I was little. Some of my favorite costumes I’ve 
                done in the past were Sharpay from High School Musical, Dwight from 
                The Office, and Shaggy from Scooby Doo.</p>
